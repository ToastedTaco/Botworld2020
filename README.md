# Botworld2020
This is my code for BotWorld 2020, which implements a Dijkstra path-finding method to find the cheapest locations to move to within the next available spaces.
SmallBusiness.java is my competion bot
Evasion.java is a visual representation of my path-finding code that I used to develop/implement my Dijkstra logic
